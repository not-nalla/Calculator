# Calculator Program in C 

## Description
This is a simple calculator program written in C. It performs basic arithmetic operations using a `switch` statement. The program works with integer values and includes support for the modulo (`%`) operator.

## Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulo (`%`)
- Handles division and modulo by zero
- Beginner-friendly implementation

## Technologies Used
- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler

## Program Explanation
This C program implements a simple calculator using a `switch` statement. It takes two integer inputs and an operator from the user, then performs the selected arithmetic operation. The program supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. Division and modulo by zero are safely handled, and invalid operators are reported with an error message.
